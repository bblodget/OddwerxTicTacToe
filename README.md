Oddwerx Tic Tac Toe
============================

This web app plays a game of Tic Tac Toe and communicates
the moves via the cloud to an [Ologic Oddwerx robot](http://www.oddwerx.com) that physically pushes X's
and O's on a large game board.

This app was developed for the Cloud Robotics Hackathon.
It uses the [MyRobots cloud service](http://www.myrobots.com)

enjoy,
